# Retail-Sales-Dataset-Master_Excel
🧾 Excel Retail Sales Analysis

This project presents a simple but insightful analysis of retail sales data using Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts. The focus is on understanding purchasing patterns across customer gender, product categories, and age groups.

The project is split into two independent mini-analyses:

📊 Analysis 1: Product Sales Distribution by Gender

This section analyses the percentage contribution of each product category (Beauty, Clothing, Electronics) to total sales, broken down by gender.

Electronics lead slightly among male customers at ~17.6%.
Overall sales contribution is quite evenly distributed across categories (~34% each), indicating a well-balanced product offering.
Females contribute slightly more to Beauty and Clothing, while Males dominate in Electronics.
